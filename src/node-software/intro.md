# Node Software Guide

With more than half a decade of experience operating more than 50 blockchain networks,
weâ€™ve noticed some patterns that make a network easy to operate reliably,
and also some pitfalls that less mature networks might not be aware of.
In this section we describe what from our point of view is the ideal way
to build a blockchain network that can be operated reliably.
By sharing our perspective,
we aim to help networks build better software and more stable mainnets.

TODO: Should we make some ranking of what is non-negotiable and what is nice-to have?
We could mark requirements P0 through P4 or something?
