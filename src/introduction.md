Welcome to [Chorus One][chorus]â€™s _Network Handbook_.
Chorus One is one of the leading node operators for decentralized networks.
We operate validators for proof-of-stake blockchains
and infrastructure for adjacent projects.
We have many years of experience operating more than 50 networks,
and through that we learned a lot
about how we can operate such networks securely and reliably.

In this book we explain how we operate nodes
and what we like to see from node software to enable us to do that reliably.
The goal of this book is to help new and existing networks improve
by sharing insights, best practices,
and patterns that emerged from operating nodes at scale,
which may not be obvious to the developers when launching a new network.

Aside from helping blockchain networks to improve,
this book offers our delegators a glimpse into how we operate our nodes.
Transparency is a core value at Chorus One,
and we believe that by being transparent,
we can help you make a more informed decision of which validator to delegate to.

Finally,
we are always looking for talented engineers to join our team,
and this book gives a good overview of the work we do on a daily basis.
If the problems we solve sound interesting to you,
[check out our open positions][careers]!
